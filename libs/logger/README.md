# Reflector Log Library

## Version

This library is currently in alpha version. Keep in mind, An alpha version of a software product is a pre-release version that is typically not complete but includes most of the major features. It's often used for internal testing and development purposes.

**Here are some key points about alpha versions:**

- Not feature-complete: Some features may be missing or incomplete.
- Internal testing: Alpha versions are often used for testing within the development team or organization.
- Bugs and instability: Because it's a pre-release version, an alpha version may have bugs and could be unstable.
- Feedback and improvements: The purpose of releasing an alpha version is to gather feedback and make improvements before releasing a more stable beta version.

[!IMPORTANT]
Remember, using an alpha version in a production environment is generally not recommended due to potential instability and the presence of bugs.

## What and Why?

Logging is a critical aspect of software development. It provides visibility into the behavior of a running application. Here are a few reasons why logging is important:

- **Debugging:** Logs can provide detailed context about what the application was doing when an issue occurred. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.
- **Performance Monitoring:** By logging performance metrics, you can identify bottlenecks and optimize your application for better performance.
- **Security:** Logs can be used to detect suspicious activity and potential security threats.
- **Compliance:** Many industries require logging for compliance with regulations.
- **Problem Diagnosis:** If an error occurs in the application, logs can help to trace the problem.
- **User Behavior:** Logs can also be used to understand user behavior, helping to drive business decisions.

Incorporating logging in your application from the start can save a lot of time and effort in the long run. It's much easier to debug a problem with a good set of logs than to try to reproduce an issue or guess what might have gone wrong.

## High Dependency

**reflect-metadata** is a library that allows for metadata reflection in JavaScript. It's often used in conjunction with decorators, which are a design pattern that allows for modifying or annotating classes, properties, methods, and parameters without altering the original code. Here are a few reasons why you might want to use reflect-metadata:

- **Type Information:** reflect-metadata allows you to access type information at runtime. This can be useful for tasks like validation or serialization.
- **Annotations:** You can use reflect-metadata to add metadata to your classes, methods, etc. This can be used to configure behavior without changing the code itself.
- **Design Patterns:** reflect-metadata is often used in conjunction with the decorator pattern, which allows for powerful and flexible code structures.

Logging, as mentioned in the README excerpt, is crucial for understanding the behavior of your application, debugging issues, monitoring performance, ensuring security, and more. When used together, reflect-metadata and logging can provide a powerful toolset for building and maintaining your application. For example, you could use reflect-metadata to annotate which methods should be logged, and then use a logging library to automatically log calls to those methods.

## Based on Decorators and AOP

**Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification. This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic (such as logging, security, caching, etc.) to be added to a program without cluttering the code that is core to the functionality.

AOP forms a basis for modularizing common tasks that are spread across scattered parts of the code, known as cross-cutting concerns. Examples of aspects are logging, transaction management, data validation, and security which are typically scattered throughout a code base. By modularizing these concerns, the main program logic can remain clean and uncluttered with such code.

**Decorators** provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members. Here are a few reasons why you might want to use decorators:

- **Code Organization:** Decorators can help to keep your code organized by allowing you to attach metadata or modify behavior in a way that's separate from your main code.
- **Code Reusability:** Decorators can be defined once and applied in many places, promoting code reusability.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Decorators allow you to separate concerns by encapsulating additional functionality or behavior that's not part of the main logic.
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Decorators can be used to enhance the functionality of classes, methods, properties, or parameters without altering their definitions.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming:** Decorators are a fundamental part of aspect-oriented programming (AOP), a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
